Maya (Turkish word for "yeast") is a fullstack web application boilerplate. The main goal of this repo is to present a good project structure that is easy to work on and easy to scale. 

### Disclaimer

### Tech Stack:

- TypeScript
- React
- Node.js
- Express
- tRPC
- PG-Promise
- PostgreSQL
- Zustand
- React-query
- Zod
- Sessions
- Helmet
- Winston
- Husky
- Eslint
- Prettier
- Lint Staged

## Get Started

You must have Node, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Yarn installed. Use `dotenv.example` as a template to create a `.env` file and fill-in/change all the values.

To install all the dependencies, run `yarn install-dependencies` on root folder. You can then run `yarn start` to start both the API server and client.


#### To-Do
- Docker
- Shared types
- Session based auth
